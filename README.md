# Serverless Autocomplete

A simple trie implementation using AWS lambda function with the serverless framework, and [lambda store](http://lambda.store/) as a persistence layer.

A demo frontend is available [here](http://autocomplete.paolorechia.de.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/).

To use the demo, you need to set an api-key in the browser local storage, ask me if you want to try it :)
